							<p>We implement the project called system review system, 
							which provide people an efficient way to organize their reading achievement and make use of collective intelligence. 
							</p>
							<p>Lots of scholars are dealing with bounds of journal papers and articles every day. 
							There are requirements for recording some notes about these papers, so that readers can recall the contents and key points he appreciate. 
							In addition, people are willing to check other reader’s view about the same papers and receive comments targeting his own publicized comments.
							</p>
							<p>Many professors rely on product including “End note”, “Mondeley”, “Papars” etc. 
							Of course, there are inadequacies. 
							Based on our survey, many people are in desperate need for a literature review system with minimum limitation on the format of the notes. 
							Therefore we propose to start a project to building this kind of literature review system.
							</p>
							<p>This system simplifies the daunting work for typing in these papers to the system, 
							rather, it provide the function of using only URL and paper name to identify each paper in the servers database 
							and view it in the local browser. 
							</p>
							<p>This system also allows all the users to publicize their notes and receive others’ comments. 
							Ideally, scholar who does not know each other can form a meaning discussion and exchange views about the same article. 
							We hope this system can help scholars reading papers in a more efficient way.
