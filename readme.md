# Co-Papers
Co-papers is an online system for managing bibliographies and reading notes. It supports basic functions like read, write, search, and share. Users can also register and log into the system to comment on others' notes and follow their favorite users. For more information, please refer to our [final report](https://github.com/Davin-Yu/Co-Papers/blob/master/report/CSE208-Group4-FinalReport1.0.pdf) for this project :)
